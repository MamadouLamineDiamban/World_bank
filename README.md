About Dataset
59 world development indicators downloaded from the website of the World Bank on 30 May 2024, covering the whole world and spanning more than six decades, are included in this dataset.

You are invited to:

explore correlations between the indicators
explore time trends
perform causal inference on the data, that itself is only observational in nature
try to predict the future course of the development indicators per country
do whatever analysis sparks your interest!
A challenge is the number of missing values. Some indicators have been measured since 1960 (for example: Urban population (% of total population)), but others (for example: Individuals using the Internet (% of population), but also Access to electricity (% of population)) only since much later. Those are differences between indicators, but there are also differences between countries in what indicators they have measured and since when. There is an increase over time regarding the completeness of the data, with the data being most complete from 2010 to 2021. For the last two years, 2022 and 2023, a lot of data is missing because of the time it costs to produce these statistics.

Apart from 217 countries there are also country aggregates that can be based on location (for example: Latin America & Caribbean) or on other characteristics (for example: Low income or OECD members). Think well if you want to include these in your analysis or not.
